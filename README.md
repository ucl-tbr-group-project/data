TBR Data
========

This repository contains data produced by the tritium breeding ratio Monte Carlo simulation.


Usage
-----

The repository is divided into multiple runs, each corresponding to a separate directory. For the reasons of scalability, runs are divided into a multitude of batches that correspond to individual jobs scheduled at a computing cluster. These are labeled by file prefix (e.g. `batch42...`).

Each batch consists of two files:

    1. `_in.csv` file that contains data points in the TBR parameter domain to be sampled,
    2. `_out.csv` file that repeats the contents of the `_in.csv` file but also includes the results of the TBR simulation for each data point.

Sometimes, data handling scripts are included for convenience.
